**react** is component based, declarative and state driven

# **component**-> A component is js fuction that contains a piece of ui(both its content and functionality). We build complex UIs by combining multiple components

# **Declarative**-> we only describe what the UI should look like, using a sntax called JSX. Developers never manipulate the DOM directly!

# **Driven by state**-> state is the data that the UI is based on. When we change the state in a component, React automatically updates the DOM. This always _keep the ui synced with the data_

# Analytics vs Analysis->

Analytics- data based
Analysis- reason based

// apply statistical tools like chi-square test on big data

// apply statistical tools on audio, video, images like data.
// in a way that it is automated
develop new statistical tools or use just the old one

// in react we can't pass data to bottom to top for ex:-
App->Header not Header->App

> withour the dependency array in the useEffect the data will be fetched every time some state is updated in page.
